Trustless Emission Profit Sharing 

Each module can profit share its own emission by specifying the fraction of emissions it wants to split across any key. This allows for any module to profit share its emission with any other key (even if its a module).

```python 
keys = ["5E2SmnsAiciqU67pUT3PcpdUL623HccjarKeRv2NhZA2zNES", "5ERLrXrrKPg9k99yp8DuGhop6eajPEgzEED8puFzmtJfyJES"]
shares = [0.5, 0.5]
c.add_profit_sharing(keys=keys ,shares=shares, netuid=0)
```
